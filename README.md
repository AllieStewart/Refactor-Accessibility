# Challenge-1

## Description
Challenge 1 coursework for UT bootcamp.
I am to refactor code for a website from a cloned repository, provided
for by UT bootcamp from the challenges directory, to make it more accessible
to people with disabilities and/or screen readers.
I am following ADA and WCAG standards, to make it compliant.

## Credits
Made by Allie Stewart.

I looked into https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp and 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML for 
further assistance on creating accessibility-friendly and semantic coding practices.

## What I Learned
I learned a lot about making this website more accessiblity-friendly, 
and using more semantic language over non-semantic for better readability for code.
I have also implemented comments for other developers to know what I changed within the code
of each file.
